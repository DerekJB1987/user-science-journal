        <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
          <p>The last post in my User Science Journal is a summary of the story for my Goal Experiment Report.</p>
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">Process</h2>

          <p>My goal was to create both two destination goals where any visitors reading my Week 8 Post: <a href="/post8.html">Goooaaaal! (and Funnel)</a> would click on one of the hyperlinks I 
            provided. The hyperlinks direct the visitor to two articles I found on popsci.com that showed a few Thanksgiving data analyses taken from individuals who used 
            Google Maps during the week of Thanksgiving 2016 and Thanksgiving 2017. I choose this goal because found it relevant since the post was written during Thanksgiving 
            week in 2018 plus, I wanted to include data analyses in my posts hoping that people would be interested to read conclusions derived from data taken from Google’s Maps API.</p>

          <p>I implemented my goals in my site by following my professor’s instructional video to set up the WordPress GA Event’s Plugin. I added in a specific id to each element 
            such as <b>thanksgiving-2017 click</b> to the article that had Thanksgiving 2017 trends and data then added <b>thanksgiving-2016 click</b> to the article that showed Thanksgiving 2016 
            data and trends. At this point, I went into the Google Analytics Scroll Events Plugin for WordPress and added each id above as a specific event for click tracking.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Activating and creating Google Analytics Click Tracking</span>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Experience</h2>

          <p>To implement my own Content Experiment, I first accessed the experiments option in the Behavior report in Google Analytics. Currently there is a Learn More option 
            that directs a developer to the Google Optimize dashboard. I hypothesize that since this is still in beta testing that Google isn’t heavily marketing it right now 
            for fear of alienating users who are using and most familiar with the current Google experiments features. 
            For a detailed explanation on how to Set-Up a content experiment, please refer to my earlier post tilted <a href="/post9.html">Content Experiments</a></p>

          <p>The results of my content experiment are as follows: my site got a total of 11 experiment sessions over the four days that the experiment was tested, Saturday 
            December 1st, 2018 at 11pm PST to Wednesday December 5th, 2018 at 2pm PST. The overwhelming majority of my sessions were on Sunday December 2nd 2018 with seven 
            registered hits. There was one session on December 4th and another three on December 5th which could be attributed to this is the most convenient time for my 
            fellow classmates to visit our User Science Journals to complete their assigned peer reviews.</p>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/optimize_summary.png" alt="">
            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Google Analytics Optimize Summary</span>

          <p>Overall looking at the remaining “cards” in the Reporting tab it appears that my data is not viable as I had zero conversions. As a result, I will briefly 
            describe each card for educational purposes.</p>

          <p><b>Improvement Card:</b> compares the performance of the original site to the variant(s), with their percent improvement against the experiment’s objective(s).</p>

          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/optimize_Improvement.png" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Google Analytics Optimize Improvement Overview</span>

          <p>The last tab is a simply graphical representation of conversion rate over time based upon the goal selected in the drop-down menu.</p>

          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/optimize_goalOne.png" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Google Analytics Optimize Conversion Rate over Time - Goal One</span>

          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/optimize_goalTwo.png" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Google Analytics Optimize Conversion Rate over Time - Goal Two</span>

          <p>My next steps would be to change my goals to something more easily quantified such as session duration that would match approximately how long it takes an average 
            user to read the post. I would also change the experiment duration to last at least two weeks per Google’s recommendations.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

          <p>In conclusion, I was not successful in driving users to my goal for two reasons. Firstly, I set up my goals incorrectly in week 8 "Gooooaaaal! (and Funnel) and 
            any completed goals were registered as events after checking all data the following week. Also, I had eleven experiment sessions over the 87 hours that my 
            experiment lasted and did not have one successful conversion last week.</p>
            
          <p>The two most logical reasons that I can think that hinders users from achieving my goal is 1) I set up my goal incorrectly, so Google Analytics doesn’t 
            accurately register destination “click” hits as conversions or completed goals and this carries over into Google Optimize in some capacity. 
            Additionally, the destination URLs on my page are too far down the page that the visitor loses interest before seeing them and leaves my site beforehand.</p>

          <p>I personally find myself more comfortable with this data collection and usage as I see it a predominantly anonymous when being used for educational purposes however, 
            I know that the functionality exists to easily track users by IP address and sites visited.</p>

          <p>This could lead to sites and developers tracking people’s shopping purchases, personal viewing preferences (NSFW) and entertainment sites (social media) and 
            potentially indirectly collecting personal data. Tracking social media sites would make it impossible not to track personal data that would deter users from 
            trusting companies from collecting data that may be used for educational purposes to enhance the user experience for products and services.</p>

          <p>As someone who is beginning the steps towards a web development career and culture yet is still predominately a consumer it is easy to resist any temptation to 
            use less ethical means to convert users. I also would believe at this point in my education of web development and data analytics that using anything unethical to 
            trick users to  convert would result in invalid data that is useless to the developer, product manager and marketing team.</p>

          <p>These tools are extremely useful to anyone who requires data collection and analysis for educational or commercial purposes. I can still see value in the data 
            collected even in my experiment with zero experiment conversions and goals completed at three weeks into this project.</p>

          <p>The attached images reveal that I had thirteen users visit my site over three weeks with 19 recorded sessions and an average session of 4 minutes and 27 seconds. 
            My bounce rate is over 60% which is high and I cannot conclude that users found what they were looking for immediately since I had zero experiment conversions. 
            Google Analytics also indicates that all but two of my users visited my site at 10am or late in the day.</p>

            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/audienceSummary.png" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Audience Summary Report</span>

          <p>Google Analytics also shows that all of my visitors are from the United States and 13 of my users were direct while the remaining were referrals.</p>

          <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/location_acquisitionSummary.png" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Audience Summary Report</span>
  
          <p>The views indicating which pages my users visit is a great source of information for developers to analyze and see which pages are attracting visitors as well 
            as the best suited places to include goals or experiments to convert users.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Active Users & Pages Summaries</span>
  
          <p>The remaining metrics reveal the top devices visitors use to access my site as well as how well I or others would perform in retaining our visitors.</p>
